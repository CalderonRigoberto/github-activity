# Github User Activity CLI

A command-line github user activity application built as part of my Java learning journey following the [roadmap.sh]([https://roadmap.sh](https://roadmap.sh/projects/task-tracker)) path. This project demonstrates practical implementation of modern Java features while helping others learn through real-world examples.

## About This Project
